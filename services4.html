            <h3 style="margin-top: -15px;">Civil Litigation / Dispute Resolution </h3>
            <p style="font-size:16px; margin-top: 10px;">Civil matters are private disputes between individuals or organisations that claim a remedy for one party's actions or inaction that results in financial loss or other injury to the other party. Our job is to determine who is responsible for the loss or injury, and seek redress. Our team's combined experience in this area transcends a wide array of legal matters and the full spectrum of challenges before the Magistrates' Courts, High Court, and Court of Appeal, with tremendous success in complex, multi-faceted cases across multiple jurisdictions. We offer holistic, calculated and effective advice on every matter, avoiding expensive and time consuming litigation whenever possible, working tirelessly to achieve success for our clients through innovative settlement approaches, with the aim of reducing costs while still achieving the greatest possible benefit in each case.</p></div>
