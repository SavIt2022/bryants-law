                Our core team has experience in many aspects of criminal law including both defending and prosecuting cases at trial and appeals, providing legal aid to indigent accused and empowering others to defend themselves, and providing opinions on complex legal issues to defence lawyers and prosecutors, the judiciary, the Attorney General, the police and other public agencies involved in the criminal justice system. We have been involved in various aspects of criminal justice reform, including acting as intervenors and submitting pauper briefs in constitutional cases, advising task forces and police forces on policing, sentencing and penal reform, and conducting empirical research on access to justice in criminal courts.</p>
