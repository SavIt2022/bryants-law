            <h3>Business and Commercial Law</h3>

            <p  style="font-size:15px;">
                This area of law deals with the body of rules governing commercial transactions, i.e. the provision of goods and services in exchange for payment, and includes developing a business model, establishment and governance of corporate entities, hiring and managing labour, regulatory compliance, financial accounting, and sale and distribution of goods and services. We regularly act for all types of entities engaged in business, ranging from individual, small and medium enterprises to large multinational corporations. Whether you are starting a new business venture, or are an existing business addressing new requirements or emerging risks, our team has the necessary expertise and utilises the necessary strategies to help you navigate an increasingly complex environment to address your day-to-day business needs.
